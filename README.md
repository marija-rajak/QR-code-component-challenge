## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My focus lately was JS and Angular, so it is nice to refreshn the basics, from time to time. Also, I took the most simple challenge in order to see how these projects are designed-to complete the documentation, deployment etc.


### Continued development

SInce this was very basic project, it coud be improved by replacing flexbox with grid, or to try Angular (just for fun!)
