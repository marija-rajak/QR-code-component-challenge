## Overview

### Screenshot

![desktop screenshot](./screenshots/desktop.png)
![mobile screenshot](./screenshots/mobile.png)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

My focus lately was JS and Angular, so it is nice to refreshn the basics, from time to time. Also, I took the most simple challenge in order to see how these projects are designed-to complete the documentation, deployment etc.


### Continued development

SInce this was very basic project, it coud be improved by replacing flexbox with grid, or to try Angular (just for fun!)
